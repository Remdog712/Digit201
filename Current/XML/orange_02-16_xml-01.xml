<dish>Country Loaf (Pain de Campagne)</dish>

<author>Deb Lindsey for The Washington Post</author>

<DATE>SEP 10, 2014</DATE>
<NOTES>Washington author Sam Fromartz has been making sourdough variations of this yeast bread for years. Here, he adds fermented cider for flavor. A mild beer may be substituted; an IPA would be too bitter. The loaf is sized to last a few days.

The optional <TBsp>tablespoon</TBsp> of <ing>water</ing> is to compensate for the variable absorption of the <ing>rye</ing> and <ing>whole-wheat flours</ing>.

You'll need a <tool>colander</tool>, a pastry cloth or clean dish towel and a covered <pot>cast-iron</pot> or enameled <pot>cast-iron pot</pot>.

Make Ahead: The dough needs four <number>20</number>-<time>minute</time> rests, plus an <time>8-to-24-hour</time> stay in the <app>refrigerator</app> and a final <time>1 1/2-hour</time> rise.

Storage Notes: Store the cooled <dish>loaf</dish> in a <tool>paper bag</tool> for a day, and store in a <tool>plastic bag</tool> for a few days after that. Do not refrigerate.</NOTES>

INGREDIENTS
<number>1 1/4</number> <c>cups</c> (<number>160</number> <g>grams</g>) <ing>white bread flour</ing>, plus more for dusting
<number>1/4</number> <c>cup</c> (<number>38</number> <g>grams</g>) <ing>stone-ground whole-wheat flour</ing>
<number>1/4</number> <c>cup</c> (<number>32</number> <g>grams</g>) <ing>stone-ground whole rye flour</ing>
<number>1/2 </number><tsp>teaspoon</tsp> <ing>instant yeast</ing> or <ing>bread machine yeast</ing>
<number>1 </number><tsp>teaspoon</tsp> <season>table salt</season>
<number>1/4</number> <c>cup</c> (<number>55</number> <g>grams</g>) <ing>dry fermented cider</ing> (may substitute Pilsener beer; see headnote)
<number>1/2</number> <c>cup</c> (<number>120</number> <g>grams</g>) lukewarm water (80 <temp>degrees</temp>), plus an optional 1 <TBsp>tablespoon</TBsp>
DIRECTIONS
<DIRECTIONS><tool>Whisk</tool> together the <ing>flours</ing>, <ing>yeast</ing> and <ing><season>salt</season></ing> in a <tool>mixing bowl</tool>. Combine the <ing>cider</ing> and water in a <tool>liquid measuring <c>cup</c></tool>.

Add the liquid to the <ing>flour</ing> mixture; use a <tool>spatula</tool> or <tool>bench scraper</tool> or your hand moistened with water to blend them for about a <time>minute</time>. The dough should be shaggy yet cohesive. Cover the <tool>bowl</tool> with a <tool>towel</tool>; let the dough rest for <number>20</number> <time>minutes</time>.

Moisten your kneading hand. If the dough seems stiff, add the optional <TBsp>tablespoon</TBsp> of water. Stretch one edge of the dough (still in the <tool>bowl</tool>), then press it into the center of the <tool>bowl</tool>. Repeat this about a <number>dozen</number> times, moving clockwise to catch all sides of the dough. (This should take <number>1</number> or <number>2</number> <time>minutes</time>.)

Turn the dough over so the seams are on the bottom. Cover and let rest for <number>20</number> <time>minutes</time>. Repeat the clockwise stretching and folding <number>two</number> more times, with <number>20</number>-<time>minute</time> rests after each. Cover and refrigerate at least<number> 8</number> <time>hours</time> and up to <number>24</number> <time>hours</time>. The dough should have doubled. If it hasn't, leave it on the counter until it does.

Lightly <ing>flour</ing> a work surface. Use a <tool>pastry cloth</tool> or <tool>clean dish towel</tool> to line a round <tool>colander</tool>. Dust the <tool>cloth</tool> with <ing>flour</ing>.

Transfer the dough to the floured work surface. Fold the edges toward the center to create a round shape, turning it over so the seams are on the bottom. Let it rest for <number>5</number> <time>minutes</time>, then transfer to the <tool>colander</tool>, seam side up. Cover with a <tool>towel</tool> and let the dough rise for <number>1 1/2</number> <time>hours</time>.

<number>Thirty</number> <time>minutes</time> before baking, place a <tool><pot>cast-iron</pot></tool> Dutch oven (lid on) or enameled <tool><pot>cast-iron pot</pot></tool> with a lid (on) in the <app>oven</app>; preheat to <number>475</number> <temp>degrees</temp>.

Carefully remove the hot <tool><pot>pot</pot></tool> from the <app>oven</app>.

Turn the dough out onto the counter so the seams are on the bottom. Use <tool>kitchen scissors</tool> to make <number>8</number> snips on the top of the dough in an evenly spaced spoke pattern, each about <number>1/4</number>-<in>inch</in> deep. Lift the dough and carefully drop it into the hot <pot><tool>pot</tool></pot>. Immediately cover with the hot lid. Bake for <number>30</number> <time>minutes</time>, then reduce the heat to <number>450</number> <temp>degrees</temp>. Uncover and bake for <number>8 to 10</number> <time>minutes</time> or until the crust is dark brown. Try to minimize the amount of time the <app>oven</app> door is open.

The <dish>bread</dish> is done when its internal temperature registers <number>205</number> <temp>degrees</temp> on an <tool>instant-read thermometer</tool> and the <dish>loaf</dish> sounds hollow when knocked on the underside.

Transfer the <dish>loaf</dish> to a <tool>wire rack</tool> to cool for at least <number>1 </number><time>hour</time> before cutting.</DIRECTIONS>
