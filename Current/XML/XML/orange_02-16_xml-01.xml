    <dish>Country Loaf (Pain de Campagne)</dish>

<author>Deb Lindsey</author> for The Washington Post

<date>SEP 10, 2014</date>
Washington author Sam Fromartz has been making sourdough variations of this yeast bread for years. Here, he adds fermented cider for flavor. A mild beer may be substituted; an IPA would be too bitter. The loaf is sized to last a few days.

The optional tablespoon of water is to compensate for the variable absorption of the rye and whole-wheat flours.

You'll need a colander, a pastry cloth or clean dish towel and a covered cast-iron or enameled cast-iron pot.

Make Ahead: The dough needs four 20-minute rests, plus an 8-to-24-hour stay in the refrigerator and a final 1 1/2-hour rise.

Storage Notes: Store the cooled loaf in a paper bag for a day, and store in a plastic bag for a few days after that. Do not refrigerate.

SERVINGS:
Tested size: <measure>10-12 servings</measure>; makes one <measure>11-ounce</measure> <dish>loaf</dish> <measure>10 to 12 slices</measure>

<measure>1/4 cup</measure> (<measure>32 grams</measure>) stone-ground whole rye flour
<measure>1/2 teaspoon</measure> instant yeast or bread machine yeast

DIRECTIONS
<tool>Whisk</tool> together the <ingr>flours</ingr>, <ingr>yeast</ingr> and <ingr>salt</ingr> in a <tool>mixing bowl</tool>. Combine the <ingr>cider</ingr> and <ingr>water</ingr> in a <tool>liquid measuring cup</tool>.

Add the <ingr>liquid</ingr> to the <ingr>flour mixture</ingr>; use a <tool>spatula</tool> or b<tool>ench scraper</tool> or your <tool>hand moistened with water</tool> to blend them for about a <time>minute</time>. The dough should be shaggy yet cohesive. Cover the <tool>bowl</tool> with a <tool>towel</tool>; let the dough rest for <time>20 minutes</time>.

Moisten your kneading hand. If the dough seems stiff, add the optional <measure>tablespoon</measure> of water. Stretch one edge of the dough (still in the <tool>bowl</tool>), then press it into the center of the bowl. Repeat this about a <measure>dozen times</measure>, moving clockwise to catch all sides of the dough. (This should take <time>1 or 2 minutes</time>.)

Turn the dough over so the seams are on the bottom. Cover and let rest for<time> 20 minutes</time>. Repeat the clockwise stretching and folding <measure>two more times</measure>, with<time> 20-minute</time> rests after each. Cover and refrigerate at least <time>8 hours</time> and up to <time>24 hours</time>. The dough should have doubled. If it hasn't, leave it on the counter until it does.

Lightly <ingr>flour</ingr> a work surface. Use a <tool>pastry cloth</tool> or <tool>clean dish towel</tool> to line a round <tool>colander</tool>. Dust the <tool>cloth</tool> with <ingr>flour</ingr>.

Transfer the dough to the floured work surface. Fold the edges toward the center to create a round shape, turning it over so the seams are on the bottom. Let it rest for <time>5 minutes</time>, then transfer to the <tool>colander</tool>, seam side up. Cover with a <tool>towel</tool> and let the dough rise for <time>1 1/2 hours</time>.

<time>Thirty minutes</time> before baking, place a <tool>cast-iron Dutch oven</tool> (lid on) or <tool>enameled cast-iron pot with a lid</tool> (on) in the <app>oven</app>; preheat to <temp>475 degrees</temp>.

Carefully remove the hot pot from the <app>oven</app>.

Turn the dough out onto the counter so the seams are on the bottom. Use<tool> kitchen scissors</tool> to make <measure>8 snips</measure> on the top of the dough in an evenly spaced spoke pattern, each about <measure>1/4-inch deep</measure>. Lift the dough and carefully drop it into the<tool> hot pot</tool>. Immediately cover with the <tool>hot lid</tool>. Bake for <time>30 minutes</time>, then reduce the heat to <temp>450 degrees</temp>. Uncover and bake for <time>8 to 10 minutes</time> or until the crust is dark brown. Try to minimize the amount of time the <app>oven</app> door is open.

The bread is done when its internal temperature registers<temp> 205 degrees</temp> on an <tool>instant-read thermometer</tool> and the loaf sounds hollow when knocked on the underside.

Transfer the loaf to a <tool>wire rack</tool> to cool for at least <time>1 hour</time> before cutting.
